# Game of Life

Implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) following a simple set of rules

* Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
* All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
